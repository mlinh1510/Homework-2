I. Introduction:
This project has 3 parts:
   - Part 1 read data from input in date format: March 1, 1990. Any date not following that format is incorrect and should be ignored. This program using 
      find() method to check if get_date matches with date_format. I also using while loop to check until input not equal to -1. I import datetime module       to extract a current date. Any date later than current date should be ignored. 
      
   - Part 2 is the mofified program that it reads data from input file.
   
   - Part 3 is after read data from the input file, it writes out the correct format date into a new output file in format: 3/9/2022. Any date later           than current date should be ignored.
